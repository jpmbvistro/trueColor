# True Color

This project was made for a coding challenge to create a horoscope. In dedication to those who do not know their exact birth dates, or wish not to celebrate that date, I created the application dedicated to producing a hex color based on the user's chosen date. Whether that date be their birthday or otherwise is up to their discretion. Hopefully it becomes one of their favored colors.
